Hey 👋 My name is Giorgio, but most people just call me Gio.

🔭 I’m currently working at a Health Care + Fintech (funded) startup as the 1st engineer.

👯 I’m **looking to hire our 2nd engineer**. Stack:

- GCP
- MySQL
- Node
- TypeScript
- React

Interested? Message me at hiring@gdelgado.ca with a quick intro about you and a description of the hardest problem you've personally solved (or the most impressive thing you've ever built).
