Hey 👋 My name is Giorgio, but most people just call me Gio.

🔭 I’m currently working at a Health Care + Fintech (funded) startup as its founding engineer. We recently hired our 2nd engineer and we're now looking for a short-term contractor to help us keep moving fast. 

👯 Stack:

- GCP
- MySQL
- Node + TypeScript
- React + TypeScript

Interested? Message me at hiring@gdelgado.ca.
